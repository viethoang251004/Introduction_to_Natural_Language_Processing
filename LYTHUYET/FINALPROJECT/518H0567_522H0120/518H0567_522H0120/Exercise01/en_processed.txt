the only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today .
in the end , we will remember not the words of our enemies , but the silence of our friends .
the best way to predict the future is to create it .
happiness is not something ready-made .
it comes from your own actions .
the journey of a thousand miles begins with one step .
life is what happens when you're busy making other plans .
don't watch the clock ; do what it does .
keep going .
you must be the change you wish to see in the world .
in three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life : it goes on .
success is not final , failure is not fatal : It is the courage to continue that counts .
the greatest glory in living lies not in never falling , but in rising every time we fall .
to live is the rarest thing in the world .
most people exist , that is all .
life is really simple , but we insist on making it complicated .
the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago .
the second best time is now .
it does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop .
the only impossible journey is the one you never begin .
believe you can and you're halfway there .
act as if what you do makes a difference .
it does .
the mind is everything .
what you think you become .
what lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us .
you are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream .
keep your face always toward the sunshine—and shadows will fall behind you .
the only way to do great work is to love what you do .
it is our choices that show what we truly are , far more than our abilities .
your time is limited , so don't waste it living someone else's life .
not everything that is faced can be changed , but nothing can be changed until it is faced .
the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams .
the purpose of life is not to be happy .
it is to be useful , to be honorable , to be compassionate , to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well .
do not go where the path may lead , go instead where there is no path and leave a trail .
the only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be .
dream big and dare to fail .
go confidently in the direction of your dreams .
live the life you have imagined .
do what you can , with what you have , where you are .
what we achieve inwardly will change outer reality .
limitations live only in our minds .
but if we use our imaginations , our possibilities become limitless .
you don't have to be great to start , but you have to start to be great .
everything you've ever wanted is on the other side of fear .
if you can dream it , you can achieve it .
the only thing we have to fear is fear itself .
success is how high you bounce when you hit bottom .
the power of imagination makes us infinite .
keep your eyes on the stars and your feet on the ground .
believe and act as if it were impossible to fail .
the only way to achieve the impossible is to believe it is possible .
great things never came from comfort zones .
dream as if you'll live forever , live as if you'll die today .
don't count the days , make the days count .
change your thoughts and you change your world .
the only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision .
if you can imagine it , you can achieve it .
if you can dream it , you can become it .
success is not the key to happiness .
happiness is the key to success .
the journey is the reward .
i have not failed .
i've just found 10 ,000 ways that won't work .
shoot for the moon .
even if you miss , you'll land among the stars .
everything has beauty , but not everyone sees it .
you are enough just as you are .
success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it .
you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take .
the only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today .
strive not to be a success , but rather to be of value .
the best revenge is massive success .
success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm .
don’t let yesterday take up too much of today .
the best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today .
the only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing .
do not wait to strike till the iron is hot ; but make it hot by striking .
the harder the conflict , the greater the triumph .
the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious .
quality is not an act , it is a habit .
what you do today can improve all your tomorrows .
the secret of getting ahead is getting started .
to succeed in life , you need two things : ignorance and confidence .
the secret to success is to know something nobody else knows .
always do your best .
what you plant now , you will harvest later .
success is not the absence of failure ; it’s the persistence through failure .
if opportunity doesn’t knock , build a door .
do what you love and the money will follow .
a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step .
don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant .
small deeds done are better than great deeds planned .
you get what you give .
success is not how high you have climbed , but how you make a positive difference to the world .
the only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary .
the best way to predict your future is to create it .
with the new day comes new strength and new thoughts .
to handle yourself , use your head ; to handle others , use your heart .
the purpose of our lives is to be happy .
you can’t put a limit on anything .
the more you dream , the farther you get .
do not watch the clock .
do what it does .
don’t wait .
the time will never be just right .
always be a first-rate version of yourself
